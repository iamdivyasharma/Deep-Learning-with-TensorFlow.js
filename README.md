Deep Learning with TensorFlow.js: Fashion-MNIST Classification and Transfer Learning

This directory contains source code for exercises that focus on integrating AI capabilities into Node.js using TensorFlow.js. The exercises cover various aspects of building and training deep learning models.

The files in the directory include:

build-model.js: This script demonstrates how to construct and train a model using the TensorFlow.js Layers API. The model is designed to classify a subset of classes within the Fashion-MNIST dataset.

test-model.js: This script illustrates the preprocessing steps required to prepare an image for inference using a trained model. It also provides the functionality to output predictions for the given image.

transfer-learn.js: This script showcases the process of transfer learning, utilizing the pre-trained model created in build-model.js. It demonstrates how easy and efficient it is to train a classifier for the remaining classes of the Fashion-MNIST dataset.

Additionally, the directory contains a folder named sample-images, which holds a collection of example images. These images can be utilized with the test-model.js script to test and evaluate the performance of the trained models.
